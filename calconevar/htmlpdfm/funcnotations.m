% When you read your first economic papers, perhaps you are confused about function 
% notation. Economic models include potentially a lot of variables, and different 
% notations are used based on personal preference. Make sure you use consistent 
% notations, and state clearly what your notations mean.
% 
% In general, the letter $f$ represents a particular rule of mapping, if there 
% are multiple functional relationships in an economic model, different letters 
% could be used, for example:
% 
% $$y = Y(h), l = L(h), u = U(h)$$
% 
% These three equations could be from a model where:
%% 
% * $h$ is the number of hours an individual works
% * $y$ is the income that the individual makes as a function of work hours
% * $l$ is the number of leisure hours remaining as a function work hours
% * $u$ is the overall level of utility as a function of work hours.
%% 
% Or you might potentially want to use superscripts:
% 
% $$y = f^y(h), l = f^l(h), u = f^w(h)$$
% 
% Or we could use the same letter (small cap) for function as the letter for 
% the value of the function:
% 
% $$y = y(h), l = l(h), u = u(h)$$
% 
% Or maybe even more letters:
% 
% $$y = PROD(h), l = LEIS(h), u = UTIL(h)$$
% 
% Or perhaps different single letters than the output:
% 
% $$y = f(h), l = g(h), u = v(h)$$
% 
% Each notation structure could be confusing, make sure you are clear about 
% what your notations mean. Math should help make our ideas more clear to ourselves 
% and others, and that starts with clear functional notations.
