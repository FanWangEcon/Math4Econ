# Math for Economists Matlab Tutorials

This is a work-in-progress [course website](https://fanwangecon.github.io/Math4Econ/) for Mathematics for Economists, produced by [Fan](https://fanwangecon.github.io/). Course covers a limited subset of topics from *Mathematics for Economists* (Simon and Blume 1994), and uses various definitions from the book. Matlab's symbolic toolbox is used throughout.

Materials are written in matlab livescript files and shown as HTML files. To obtain matlab codes, see [here](docs/gitsetup.md) for github set up. For HTML files, click on the links below.
