# Setting up GIT to pull from this repository

You can set up your own github account if you would like. That is however not necessary for completing the following steps. Github allows us to host and share codes in the form of git repositories. git is a type of repository.

## Installing and Open up Git:
1. Download Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Install the git program, follow on-screen instructions
2. Search for the **git bash** program on your computer, open it. A window with black background opens up
3. Type in: *cd ~/*, press enter, this takes your to the user directory on your computer. Type in: *pwd*, press enter, this shows you the path to your user directory, for me, it is for example:
  ```console
  /c/Users/fan
  ```

## Clone latest files from github for Math4Econ:
1. Create a directory under your user main for git repositories (only have to do this once)
  ```console
  mkdir ~/GitRepos
  ```
2. Enter into the directory, it is just a folder on your computer
  ```console
  cd ~/GitRepos
  ```
3. Clone our repository inside GitRepos. Note that this is just downloading a folder to your computer, but rather than clicking on web page, we are downloading via command-line.
  ```console
  git clone https://github.com/FanWangEcon/Math4Econ
  ```
4. Now you can go to your folder and see our latest files. And you can open up matlab and set the directory to the one that contains Math4Econ. For me that would be this folder:
  ```console
  /c/Users/fan/GitRepos/Math4Econ
  ```
