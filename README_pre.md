This is a work-in-progress [course website](https://fanwangecon.github.io/Math4Econ/) for Mathematics for Economists. Course covers a limited subset of topics from *Mathematics for Economists* (Simon and Blume 1994), and uses various definitions from the book. Applications focus on two period borrowing and savings problems. Matlab's symbolic toolbox is used throughout.
