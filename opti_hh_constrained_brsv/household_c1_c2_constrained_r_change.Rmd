We solved previously the [Marshallian Utility Maximization
Problem](https://fanwangecon.github.io/Math4Econ/opti_hh_constrained_brsv/household_c1_c2_constrained.html)
and the [Hicksian Expenditure Minimization
Problem](https://fanwangecon.github.io/Math4Econ/opti_hh_constrained_brsv/household_c1_c2_constrained_expmin.html),
now we solve for the effect of a change in price (relative price) on
optimal choices. We decompose the effects to two ingredients, the income
and substitution effects. This is the Slutsky Decomposition. The key
point here is that when price changes, that has changes both the
relative costs but also changes income directly and indirectly.

### Utility Maximization over Consumption in Two Periods

We solved the [constrained utility maximization
probem](https://fanwangecon.github.io/Math4Econ/opti_hh_constrained_brsv/household_c1_c2_constrained.html)
already.

-   **Utility**: $U(c_1 ,c_2 )=\log (c_1 )+\beta \cdot \log (c_2 )$

-   **Budget Today and Tomorrow Together**:
    $c_1 \cdot (1+r)+c_2 =Z_1 \cdot (1+r)+Z_2$

### Solving for the Substitution Effect

There are different definitions of the substitution effect. One way of
thinking about it is that given that the change in $r$, what would the
consumption bundle be at the new prices that would give the household
the same level of utility as before. To find this point, we can solve
for the household's [Hicksian Expenditure Minimization
Problem](https://fanwangecon.github.io/Math4Econ/opti_hh_constrained_brsv/household_c1_c2_constrained_expmin.html).
But unlike before, we have to worry about two different prices, in our
case two different interest rates. Our objective function uses the
second interest rate, the new interest rate that we have shifted to. But
the targeted utility level we are trying to achieve is based on the
previous, existing interest rate.

Specifically, the difference between the solution to the problem below
and the optimal choices from the Marshallian problem given the initial
prices $r_1$ represents the substitution effect. The difference betwen
the solution to the problem below and the Marshallian problem given the
new prices $r_2$ represent the income effects:

-   **Expenditure** we want to **minimize** given **new** price $r_2$:

$$\min_{c1,c2} \left(c_2 +(1+r_2 )c_1 \right)$$

The constraint is however, a function or $r_1$, where $r_1$ determines
the $V^*$, we are shifting to some point along the blue dashed line:

-   **Constraint** we need to satisfy given **Indirect Utility** with
    **old** price $r_1$:

$$\log (c_1 )+\beta \log (c_2 )=V^* (r_1 )$$

The problem here is solves in terms of consumption in two periods, we
can relabel consumptions in the first and second periods as consumption
of Apples and Bananas in the same period. The solution method is the
same. Our first order conditions are the same as when we did the
[Hicksian Expenditure Minimization
Problem](https://fanwangecon.github.io/Math4Econ/opti_hh_constrained_brsv/household_c1_c2_constrained_expmin.html)
problem. The only difference is what the $V^{\ast }$ is based on.
Following our algebra before, the optimal choice from this problem above
is:

$$c_2^{\ast ,\textrm{substitution}} =\exp \left(\left(V^{\ast } (r_1 ,Z_1 ,Z_2 )+\log (\beta \cdot (1+r_2 ))\right)\cdot \frac{1}{1+\beta }\right)$$

Then we can find the $c_1^{\ast }$ choice as well. Below we show the
results graphically

### Optimal Consumption Choices with Different Interest Rates

In the following sections, we show the substitution and income effects
graphically. First, we already solved the [constrained utility
maximization
probem](https://fanwangecon.github.io/Math4Econ/opti_hh_constrained_brsv/household_c1_c2_constrained.html)
already, and derived the analytical solutions. Below, we solve for the
numerical values directly using matlab. We could have also used our
analytical solutions, and plugged in values. Sometimes, if it is
possible for matlab to analytically solve an equation for you, it is
perhaps better to rely on matlab to take derivatives and solve. This
way, we reduce potential errors in our algebraic derivations. We often
do like to derive the solution analytically by hand as we did in
[constrained utility maximization
probem](https://fanwangecon.github.io/Math4Econ/opti_hh_constrained_brsv/household_c1_c2_constrained.html)
to gain more insights about how parameters impact optimal choices.

Below is our numerical solutions based on matlab's analytical solution
combined with numerical values. We provide two interest rates below, and
graphically show the optimal consumption choices with corresponding
budgets and indifference curves at for each interest rate.

    beta = 0.90;
    z1 = 0.5;
    z2 = 2.5;
    syms r c1 c2 mu
    % The Lagrangian
    lagrangian = (log(c1) + beta*log(c2)) - mu*( c2 + (1+r)*c1 - z1*(1+r) - z2);
    % Given we have many symbols, type K, L, mu at the end to let matlab know what we are solving for
    solu = solve(diff(lagrangian, c1)==0, diff(lagrangian, c2)==0, diff(lagrangian, mu)==0, c1, c2, mu, 'Real', true);
    solu_c1 = (solu.c1);
    solu_c2 = (solu.c2);

At two different interest rate levels, the optimal choices and utility
at optimal choices are of course different, we can plot both out
graphically following what we did
[before](https://fanwangecon.github.io/Math4Econ/optimization_application/household_c1_c2_constrained.html).
Note that changing $r$ directly changes both left hand side and right
hand side of budget. If we were considering just apples and bananas,
unless you sell apples or bananas, the price change would only impact
the left-hand-side of the budget (which still lead to both income and
substitution effects).

### Graphical Illustration of the Income and Substitution Effect

Based on our solution method above, we can solve for the substitution
effects and income effects. The solid red dot below is the new point we
added based on the minimization problem earlier.

    syms c1 c2 lambda
    % The Lagrangian given U_at_c_opti found earlier
    lagrangian = (c2 + (1+r2)*c1 - lambda*( log(c1) + beta*log(c2) - U_at_c_opti_r1));
    % Solve
    solu_min_substitution = solve(diff(lagrangian, c1)==0, diff(lagrangian, c2)==0, diff(lagrangian, lambda)==0, c1, c2, lambda, 'Real', true);
    solu_min_substitution_c1 = double(solu_min_substitution.c1);
    solu_min_substitution_c2 = double(solu_min_substitution.c2);
    total_cost = solu_min_substitution_c2 + (1+r2)*solu_min_substitution_c1;
    disp(table(solu_min_substitution_c1, solu_min_substitution_c2, total_cost));

        solu_min_substitution_c1    solu_min_substitution_c2    total_cost

We have found the bundle along the dashed blue line where the tangent
line to the dashed blue line has the same slope as the solid red line.
We can now graph this out:

    % Same as before: The Budget Line at r1
    f_budget_r1 = z1*(1+r1) + z2 - (1+r1)*c1;
    % Same as before: Indifference at V* at r1
    f_indiff_r1 = exp((U_at_c_opti_r1-log(c1))/(beta));

    % Rather than plugging in z1*(1+r2) + z2, now we are pushing the red budget line out
    % z1_substi*(1+r2) + z2_substi = solu_min_substitution_c2 + (1+r2)*solu_min_substitution_c1
    f_budget_substitution = total_cost - (1+r2)*c1;

![](_img/household_c1_c2_constrained_r_change_images/figure_1.png){width=500px}

In the graph above, the shift between the empty blue circle and the red
solid circle is the substitution effect. Remaining changes between empty
blue circle and red blue circle are due to income effects. Note that in
this problem, the substitution effect--given higher interest rate for a
household that would like to borrow due to low endowment today--is to
reduce consumption today and increasing consumption tomorrow. The income
effect, however, is moving both consumption today and tomorrow down.

It might be puzzling whey the income effect is shifting both $c_1$ and
$c_2$ lower. This is because even though the higher interest rate
increases the right hand side of the budget constraint, that increase in
income is small relative to the effective loss in income due to the
dramatically higher cost of borrowing. In another word, the dollar level
of the household is higher due to higher interest rate, but the
purchasing power of that wealth is significantly lower due to higher
interest rate, so the higher dollar level is actually worth less in
consumption units. There is a decrease in the household's ability to
purchase consumption in both periods given the increase in interest
rate. Given that the household was borrowing before (notice where the
endowment point is), the household is hurt by the increase in interest
rate. The household now still borrows, but borrows less.

This type of problem works in the Apples and Bananas case as well.
Suppose you have endowments in Apples and Bananas, when the price of
apple increases, your wealth directly increases from selling your apples
endowments at higher prices, but you also have to pay higher cost when
you buy apple which leads to an indirect income effect and substitution
effect. In general, when our endowments are in terms of goods, changing
price tilts the budget constraint but the constraint still has to pass
through the black endowment point. If we have just some total endowment
in cash, and not in goods, meaning our endowments are not related to
prices, then our budget line, given price change would tilt at the y and
x intercepts.
