%% Why Mathmatics for Economics? What is it?
% _From Simon and Blume_:
% 
% "If we think of a model simply as the reduction and organization of subject 
% matter for study, it is clear that models are not unique to mathematical analysis. 
% Even social sciences such as sociology or anthropology, whose techniques are 
% more "literary" than mathematical, rely heavily on models of some sort..."
% 
% "Mathematical model forces the economist to define terms precisely. The 
% economist must state the underling assumptions clearly before embarking on a 
% complex train of thought..."
% 
% "Often, economsits use mathematical techniques such as logical deduction 
% to derive theorems which apply to a wide variety of economic situations..."
% 
% "It is also needed to broaden the applicability of a model that is too 
% narrowly constructed to be useful..."
